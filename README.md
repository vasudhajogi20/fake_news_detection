Fake News Detection
This repository contains a machine learning-based project to classify news articles as "fake" or "real." By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and classification algorithms, the project helps identify and combat misinformation effectively.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing text data.
Feature Extraction: Using techniques like TF-IDF for converting text to numerical features.
Modeling: Training multiple machine learning classifiers.
Evaluation: Analyzing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
Dataset
The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle. It contains labeled examples of fake and real news articles.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/vasudhajogi20/fake_news_detection.git
cd fake_news_detection
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the data/ directory.

Usage
1. Preprocess the Data
Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare the dataset:

bash
Copy
Edit
python preprocess_data.py
2. Train the Model
Train the machine learning model on the processed data:

bash
Copy
Edit
python train_model.py
3. Evaluate the Model
Evaluate the performance of the trained model:

bash
Copy
Edit
python evaluate_model.py
4. Make Predictions
Use the trained model to classify new articles:

bash
Copy
Edit
python predict.py --input "path_to_your_article"
